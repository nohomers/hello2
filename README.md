# 'Everything is Awesome' Hello World App for ~~JBoss EAP~~ GitHub Actions Testing!!

This is my take on a simple Java 'Hello World' application, which I use for testing JBoss EAP on OpenShift (and GitHub Actions java guide testing)

To get started with OpenShift Container Platform on your local computer, see the documentation for the [Red Hat Container Development Kit](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_container_development_kit/), a free developer product that uses `minishift` to quickly spin up a simple OpenShift instance for development purposes.

After you have OpenShift running, see the [Red Hat JBoss EAP for OpenShift](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_jboss_middleware_for_openshift/3/single/red_hat_jboss_enterprise_application_platform_for_openshift/) documentation for details on using Red Hat's JBoss EAP image which is specifically engineered for OpenShift.
